netuil
######

netutil is a set of assorted (and seemingly random) network utilities that I find to be re-using other multiple projects and want to store in a single location. At this point, I expect everything to be in either Python or C/C++ with python wrappers. I don't expect that this library will be useful to many in a wholesale manner, but may provide code examples to various problems.
